I created this project with the main objetive of learning the Nim programming language. It looked like well fit for purpose.

VapourSynth uses Python in order to create the processing pipelines. On the other hand, C or C++ are tipically use in order to create plugins with filters.

Nim can be used for both purposes. Besides, Nim's metaprogramming capabilities makes easier the creation of filters.
