## Installing Nim
I recommend checking the official [Nim install](https://nim-lang.org/install.html). It is straight forward.

I recommend using [choosenim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) which makes easy to control the Nim version that you want to use.

## Installing VapourSynth
In order to install VapourSynth, follow its [instructions](http://www.vapoursynth.com/doc/installation.html).

## Installing VapourSynth.nim
In order to install VapourSynth you need to use nimble:
```
$ nimble install vapoursynth
```

> TODO: right now the nimble file is created but not shared yet.
