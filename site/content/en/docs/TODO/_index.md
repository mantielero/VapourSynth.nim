## VapourSynth scripts
Being able to use VapourSynth python scripts.

## AviSynth plugins
Supporting Avisynth plugins.

## AviSynth scripts
Could this be possible?

## Supporting more formats
I have not investigated much in this front.

## Interop with other libraries
Maybe [Cairo](https://github.com/nim-lang/cairo) (or [Skia](https://mvenditto.github.io/nimskia-docsite/#/), which should be more performant), [OpenCV](https://github.com/dom96/nim-opencv), ...

## Look for some inspiration in MoviePy
For example, make easier the composition/position of clips.

## FrameEval
An alternative to [FrameEval](http://www.vapoursynth.com/doc/functions/frameeval.html).

## Audio
What to do with it?
