For large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them donâ€™t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller Docsy documentation site in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/), which lives in the [Docsy theme repo](https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/master/userguide) if you'd like to copy its docs section. 

Other content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the [About](/about/) and [Community](/community/) pages.

Find out how to use the Docsy theme in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/). You can learn more about how to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in [Organizing Your Content](https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/).
